// `message_bot` tool: the chief of staff talks to another bot by name
// (@mentions). Runs the message as a real turn in the target bot's own
// conversation — same session, system, and skills as if the user had
// written there — and returns the reply for the chief to relay.
//
// The transcript lands under the target conversationId (no parentId), so
// switching to that bot shows the chief's message and the reply. No
// approval card by design (user decision): the checkpoint is the user
// typing @Name in the chief thread.
